                <p>I'm more than pleased with the firm. I have found all calls answered in a very timely manner as well as all emails answered. Sometimes at the end of the day, when you have time to sit and think, I found I had questions and even though I didn't expect an answer until the next business day, Richard was answering them. He and Mr. Henry were very thorough as well as easy for the average person to understand.</p>

                <p>I have been a policeman for 36+ years and I have never had the need to retain an attorney until I had the unfortunate experience of getting hurt on the job. As a policeman I have been at times skeptical and doubtful of attorneys even though they play an imperative, essential, and vital role in our society. After being injured, while making an arrest, I searched out an attorney that would be empathetic to my case, which led me to your firm. To make a long story short I had to sue workers comp in order to continue with my rehabilitation of my knee, which was injured during an arrest. I was assigned Lee Bodie as my attorney, who exemplified a genuine professional demeanor from the beginning of my case through the conclusion of the case. Mr. Bodie was understanding, compassionate, and informative while vigorously pursuing my case with determined precision. Mr. Bodie always made himself available for any questions that I might have had and he made sure that I understood the proceedings of my case. I know now more than ever how crucial it is to have in your corner a competent, resolute, and passionate attorney which was provided to me. I just wanted to sincerely thank you, your firm, and most importantly Mr. Lee Bodie for the positive outcome of this case. I am truly grateful and best regards.</p>

                <p>I am so very pleased with Mr. Kropog and also his assistant Kim. Mr. Kropog calls me to check on me and I appreciate those calls. I just can't say enough good things about Mr. Kropog. One time I was hurting so bad in my body I called Kim and all I did was cry because of the pain. She was so kind. She let me cry and told me that everything was going to be ok, and for me to continue my treatment. Just talking to someone that cared made me feel better. Thank you for being there for me and for your wonderful staff. God bless you and all the good work that you do.</p>

              <p>After explaining your legal rights and options, your attorney will gather documents and evidence related to your disease. These documents may include medical records, as well as an overview of your employment history. Then, your attorney will determine the appropriate court in which to file your lawsuit. Once you have decided to file a claim, your attorney will ask you to sign a client agreement, which outlines your relationship and expectations.</p>

              <p>If the court denies the request for dismissal, each party will have an opportunity to gather and collect evidence to support their case. Typically, this will involve deposing witnesses, former employees, or anyone who may have information vital to the case; reviewing medical and work history records; and answering questions posed by the opposing party. Your mesothelioma attorney will prepare you for any questions posed by the defendant so that you can answer each one truthfully and appropriately.</p>

The appeals court will typically only reverse the verdict or send it back to the lower court if they feel that an error in law, not fact, was made. The appeals court can either deny the appeal, send the case back to be retried, or correct a miscalculation in damages. If the appeal is accepted, the court typically accepts the facts presented in the initial trial and will act in the defendant’s favor only if they believe the law was not applied properly to the case.</p>
